# Data-Analytics
Projects i worked on during my journey through data analytics

Project 1 - Prediction of Retail Sales trends using Linear Algebra

The main objective of this task is to analyze a dataset focusing on sales from the retail industry, using the principles of linear algebra. The aim of the analysis is to identify patterns and trends in sales figures by applying linear algebra techniques. By exploiting these methods, this project pursues to gain insights into the relationships between the marketing expenditure, number of products sold, sales performance and regional factors. The aim is to build a predictive analytics model to forecast future sales trends based on historical data. By building a model which predicts sales, actionable insights can be provided to optimize business strategies. This will thereby improve the decision-making process in the retail sector.


Project 2 - Optimizing Product Quality using Data Analytics

The objective of this task is to increase the process of production in a manufacturing company. Statistical techniques and machine learning models are used to identify the key factors which are influencing the product quality from the analysis of production data. The task aims to develop predictive models which can accurately foretell ways to increase production quality based on various parameters involved in production. This can ultimately enable the company to implement data-driven schemes to improve the quality of production

Project 3 - Predicting fraudulent transactions using data analytics concepts

Developing a robust system for detecting credit card fraudulent transactions is the primary objective of this task. The approach involves using machine learning and linear algebra techniques to transform transaction data into numerical vectors, feature scaling and applying anomaly detection algorithms to identify the potential fraudulent cases. Additionally, machine learning models are trained and evaluated to classify the fraudulent cases accurately. High accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions enhances the security and reliability of financial transactions. Recent studies highlight the importance of incorporating advanced machine learning techniques in the financial industry to improve detection rates and reduce false positives.
