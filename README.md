# Data-Analytics
Projects i worked on during my journey through data analytics
The main objective of this task is to analyze a dataset focusing on sales from the retail industry, using the principles of linear algebra. The aim of the analysis is to identify patterns and trends in sales figures by applying linear algebra techniques. By exploiting these methods, this project pursues to gain insights into the relationships between the marketing expenditure, number of products sold, sales performance and regional factors. The aim is to build a predictive analytics model to forecast future sales trends based on historical data. By building a model which predicts sales, actionable insights can be provided to optimize business strategies. This will thereby improve the decision-making process in the retail sector.
